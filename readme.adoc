    repositories {
        /// ....
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}

## Usage

To start ImageCrop process 

[source,java]

ScannerConstants.selectedImageBitmap=btimap
startActivityForResult(Intent(MainActivity@this, ImageCropActivity::class.java),Constants.REQUEST_CROP)
----

Catch the cropped image

[source,java]
----
if (requestCode==Constants.REQUEST_CROP && resultCode== Activity.RESULT_OK )
        {
            if (ScannerConstants.selectedImageBitmap!=null)
                imgBitmap.setImageBitmap(ScannerConstants.selectedImageBitmap)
            else
                Toast.makeText(MainActivity@this,"Something wen't wrong.",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
        }

### Additional Features

On above Android 9.0 there is magnifier to help user to see zoomed image to crop.

#### Customizing ImageCropActivity

You can customize something in layout via ScannerConstants.

[source,java]
----
    // ScannerConstants.java
    public static String cropText="CROP",
            backText="CLOSE",
            loadingDescription="Please wait",
            imageError="Can't picked image,
            please try again.",
            cropError="You have not selected a valid field. Please make corrections until the lines are blue.";
    public static String cropColor="#6666ff",backColor="#ff0000";
    public static boolean saveStorage=true; // Make it false if you don't need image in your storage.

## TO-DO

There was an error about progress dialog when doing the process. That's why I've removed it, I'll add something to disable user interract while doing process.
